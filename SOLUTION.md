# Solution Steps

1. Create the RecipeFeedback component using React useState to handle the feedback text and optimistic submissions list.

2. On form submit, do an optimistic update: append the feedback to the UI with a pending status immediately, then send the POST request in the background.

3. Implement API route /api/feedback, which takes recipeId and feedback, and saves feedback asynchronously using a mocked data store.

4. Within the same API route, after feedback persistence, trigger analytics logging asynchronously via an awaited function (not awaited; promise errors caught but not exposed to client).

5. Ensure the API route responds to the client as soon as feedback saving is complete, regardless of analytics logging.

6. On the client, update status for each feedback submission as 'pending', 'success', or 'error' based on API response; display feedback instantly after submit.

7. Handle possible API/network errors gracefully in the UI, updating status and showing error messages if necessary.
